TP53 Gene Mutations are Associated with Decreased Survival in Patients with Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: An Analysis of the International Cancer Genome Consortium 


Key Points: Does TP53 have an effect on survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma?

Findings: The presence of a TP53 mutation was found to have a statistically significant negative effect on overall survival in a total of 744 patients with a hazard ratio of 1.36. This was a retrospective cohort study using the ICGC database to create Kaplan Meier survival curves using the available patient demographics. 

Meaning: The presence of a TP53 mutation in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma carry a negative impact on overall survival.
